## CalMac's "strike"

As many readers may know, Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd provide ferry services to Colonsay, and indeed the only link to the island. It seems that morale within the company is low and for various reasons management is at odds with no less than three-vital trade unionised groups within the operation. Earlier this summer, clerical staff threatened to strike and the resultant tension led to loss of confidence and cancelled bookings throughout the Hebrides. Within the last fortnight, a dispute with the ships officers was allowed to drift right up against the wire, leading to widespread holiday cancellations and a further loss of confidence. Fortunately, a strike was averted and it is understood that harmony has been restored. Such matters are beyond the scope of this publication, but it was locally observed that less than thirty cars came to Colonsay on the Bank Holiday sailing, which can be compared with fifty eight cars in 1999 and fifty six in 1998. The financial implication is very obvious.

## Air Service for 2001

Colonsay was represented by Pede MacNeill at a recent mainland conference to discuss a proposed air service for Colonsay. He later returned to Colonsay (by air) accompanied by a delegation of officials, and an informal local meeting was held at the airstrip. Although there is a long way to go, it seems as if the needs of the wider community have been recognised - schoolchildren, medical patients, householders, professional and tradespersons etc. It seems as if fares are to be treated in a sensitive manner and that the service could become a reality within a year. Frequency might be four days per week, with a double run on certain days; there is no question of any reduction in ferry services nor in medical cover.

## Birthday Party

An excellent joint-birthday party in the New Hall for Ross Moodie and Alastair Scouller was much enjoyed by one and all. It was fortunate that the CalMac strike was cancelled - Alastair had thirty guests from far and wide, many on their first visit to the island. Ross had had a "dry run" on the Saturday night (in the pub), but our picture was taken in the Hall on Monday. There was plenty of dancing and lots of ceilidh turns, but it is said that too many pictures of dancing may make us look frivolous.

## Nature Notes

A goose, gander and two goslings on Bruthach Chomhl-airigh, and a pair of ducks being very protective of a ditch beside the Burma Road; the Hawthorn (or May) has been magnificent, also the Rowan. St. John's Wort (in three forms) is doing well and the Bluebells are outstanding. The weather seems to have been perfect for Bog Cotton and Gorse, and has made both Buckler Fern and Royal Fern more prominent than usual - but the showing of orchids seems to be reduced, especially Heath Spotted. John and Pamela Clarke's wood at Milbuie is a credit to them both, with many trees higher than the house and sure signs of regeneration from some of the pre-plantation residents. Mountain Everlasting and Sundew are brought to my attention, as are Wild Mountain Thyme and Eyebright. At Uragaig note the flowering Lady's Mantle, the Spring Vetch, Wild Strawberry and Herb Robert; there are catkins on the Silver Birch and along the Bay road there is Cow Parsley, Red Campion, Hop Trefoil and Field Madder. At Machrins, families of Ravens are exercising - the adults seem to be training the youngsters for some kind of game. On the south side of Traigh an Tobair Fhuair there are Peewits, Redshanks and Ringed Plover; at Port Mor the Shelduck are operating a creche and may be seen with up to seventeen ducklings in a crocodile. After some poor seasons recently, it is good to see so many Terns again, particularly along the east coast.

## Snippets:

Congratulations to Geordie and his wife on their new baby!; "Rumpole of the Bailey" was here on holiday last week and his sophisticated but faulty car alarm proved no match for Andrew Abrahams, Wee Davie and Jim McLoughlan who managed to neutralise it in less than an hour; Davie MacConnell's Ferguson 20 has gone to the mainland, leaving just one remaining; House of Lochar publishes "The Survival of the Bark Canoe" by Pulitzer-prizewinner John McPhee in its first European edition; Irene is back from her tour of Germany, Holland and Belgium and had a smashing time; Hughie's foundations are coming on like wildfire, and Andrew MacGregor has two enormous diggers and seems to be moving his entire plot about six inches to the right; welcome home to Flora who is in great form and fully recovered from her fall; despite lots of activity, the work at Loch an Sgoltaire is said to be bigger or longer than expected; the Hydro have had a helicopter on site to transport the electricity poles.

## Changes in "The Corncrake"

One or two readers have had trouble getting the latest issue, because their machine has elected to reload the edition it last accessed, using the cache memory. A new gizmo is to be added which should overcome the problem, but any readers in doubt should use their "refresh" button whenever they wish to see the latest version of this or any site. An additional refinement will shortly make earlier editions available from our archives. If you have trouble "seeing" the full width of text because "Favourites" are displayed, try pressing the "Favourites" button at the top of your screen to conceal/reveal them.

## What's On in Colonsay

An exhibition of work by Colonsay and Oransay artists is open before the arrival of each ferry, and is mounted in the Pier Waiting Room.
The Colonsay and Oronsay Heritage Trust is running an exhibition in the Old Waiting Room, times as advertised (usually around boat time). Colonsay House Gardens are open to the public every Wednesday, and the woodland gardens are open every day.Light lunches are available on Wednesdays, with an emphasis on organic ingredients.
There are regular BBQ's at the hotel - see notices for details.
The summer arrangements for pulpit supply are now in place. Services each Sunday are at 11.00 in Church of Scotland and 12.00 in the Baptist Church. All are welcome.
Wednesday 7 June at New Hall - Argyll & Bute Council will have a Committee meeting to discuss Housing etc.
The all-island Millenium Picnic and Party is at Seal Cottage on 17 June, following an Ecumenical Service at the Priory (by the courtesy of Mrs. F. Colburn). There is no obligation to attend the Service, but it is hoped that one and all will attend the party. Tides will permit access by vehicle or on foot, and it is hoped that boats will also be available. We gather that a "documentary" may be produced in connection with the event.

### "The Spencer" emigrants to N.S. 1806

In recent issues, there has been reference to the persons cleared from Colonsay in 1791 and 1792, and an article about a traditional memory of "How the Bells left Balnahard". In connection with the latter story, the writer has speculated that it very likely refers to the voyage of "The Spencer" from Oban to PEI in 1806.

At this point it might be worthwhile to speculate as to what process was at work; it is known that the Old Laird had inherited Oransay from his father and that he therefore had full possession of that farm. In the years before he actually purchased Colonsay itself, he had had the stewardship of the estate and had commissioned an Estate Map which shows clearly his intention to create large modern farms with a peasant labour force to be relocated into newly created 5 acre crofts in Kilchattan. Knowing that he would be moving to Kiloran House, he will have wished to create an adequate Home Farm; it seems reasonable to suppose that the migrants of 1791 and 1792 will have been domiciled in Balavetchy and the fertile part of the "twa killorans" as they were then known.

A rather earlier and smaller migration had already taken place, which may be the subject of a later article. For the moment, suffice to say that the prime movers in that first exodus were Curries and that their departure coincided with the disappearance of "Baillevurrich" (Currie's Fermtoun) from the list of local farms. We cannot as yet identify the families involved in 1791 and 1792, but hyothesise that they lived at Kiloran/Balavetchy. As we now come to look at the details of the voyage of the "Spencer" it will become clear that two families were of great significance, the MacMillans and the Bells.

The MacMillans were ancient supporters of the MacNeills, were associated with them in the history of Castle Sween, Gigha and Knapdale, and are held to have accompamied the MacNeills when they acquired Colonsay. The MacMillans were a senior branch of the Bells, who had lived in Colonsay for generations. An examination of the passenger list suggests that Malcolm MacMillan and his wife Grizel McNeill were the effective leaders of the party and that they had probably been instrumental in convincing the rest of the families to accompany them; probably Malcolm was a tacksman and/or Grizel was a close family connection of the laird. Almost all the party that travelled was inter-related and, for the first time, it has been possible to identify the entire party as being from Colonsay.

As a working hypothesis it is suggested that the purpose of the enterprise was to gain vacant possession of Kilchattan, so that crofts could be created and the remaining islanders could be rearranged in a manner convenient to the landlord. If true, the MacMillans will have been the occupants of Kilchattan, and of course the departure of the Bells will have provided an opportunity to "improve" Balnahard, their ancient home. In a future article, it will be shown that Balnahard was indeed the first of the farms to pass to a lowland grazier.

Owing to pressure of time it has not been possible to develop this theme at this time, but contributions to the study will be welcome. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it is assumed that the 1806 emigration was largely accepted as an "opportunity", although it is easy to see that some of the older passengers were not fit to undertake such a journey. It would be good to know exactly who it was that organised the voyage, chartered the ship, arranged the rendezvous at Balnahard etc.

Although the voyage is recorded as "from Oban", it is now clear that the passengers actually boarded at Colonsay and were transported directly to the New World. It is also clear that the manifest was constructed by a clerk in Nova Scotia, and records the passengers who actually landed in Canada. We know a great deal about the ship and about the fate of the passengers, and Colonsay owes a great debt to many people for their invaluable researches.

It is appropriate to thank Ann Bonnell, who has recorded and published so many Colonsay gravestones from Woods Island and other Pioneer cemeteries; and also Douglas C MacMillan whose book is the fruit of patient and scholarly work ("The MacMillans and the MacNeills who Emigrated in 1806 from the Isle of Colonsay, Argyllshire, Scotland to Prince Edward Island, Canada on the ship Spencer and settled in Wood Islands").

Totals:

Males 16 - 60 years: 35    Females 16 - 60 years: 33

Males under 16 years: 27    Females under 16 years: 16

TOTAL MALES 64    TOTAL FEMALES 51

Thus 115 individuals sailed, comprising c. 30 discrete family groups but apparently composed of a very much smaller number of extended and inter-related family groupings. All of these individuals seem to have Colonsay connections and about one third of the contingent had MacMillan or Bell connections.

The above notes against names are not exhaustive. They are based upon church registers which were very poorly kept, not least because they were kept in Jura. It may be that certain Colonsay marriages and baptisms were entered in the wrong register, but the "Jura" registers have not been examined. Extensive additional information is available about many individuals, but has not been inserted in this short article - please contact the editor if you wish to make further enquiries or have material to contribute.

Note that the original register records males and females, but does not state family relationships. It has been possible to reconstruct family groups, as originally demonstrated by Douglas C MacMillan in 1984 (although the reconstruction here differs slightly in the light of fuller background information). The numbers in the lefthand column refer to the original register and are broadly sequential by sex. For convenience, highlighting has been used to identify discrete family groups. 22nd September was the date of arrival - departure from Colonsay will have been in early August.

Footnote: Hector MacMillan who married Mary Bell died young. He operated a coasting boat and took passengers to Pictou in 1810; it is believed that he or his wife operated a ferry boat at Southport. "Hector was murdered in Charlottetown on June 28, 1819, and the inquest was held on July 8, 1819, as reported in the Island Gazette of August 16 1819. The murderer, Hardington, was convicted from testimony of "Indian Joe", branded on the hand with "M", and sentenced to 39 lashes at Market House, plus 39 at the Stocks, plus 39 at the Gaol. All of this was carried out the same day. (From file at Beaconsfield)." - quotation from Douglas C. MacMillan.

### Building a House in Colonsay

Whether this should be titled "How to Build a House in Colonsay" or "How not to Build a House in Colonsay" only time will tell.

The project started as a germ of an idea some 6 or 7 years ago as a pleasant thought for retirement which at that time seemed far, far away. However in 1996 after Margaret died I thought "Why not?" and started to make serious enquiries about possible sites. Two were unearthed, the old generator shed above the Hotel in Squint Street and a choice of 3 plots in the glebe in front of Georgina's house. A visit to Colonsay followed at Easter 1997 with Duncan and my very sceptical sister. The view won and I decided to go for the glebe plot furthest from the pier. After a major inquisition by my sister ( "What if you are ill?" etc. etc.), all answered apparently satisfactorily, I was told that when I saw her coming off the ferry with a cat basket I was in trouble. What else are older sisters for?

The next stage was to establish a price with the Church of Scotland and to apply for outline planning consent. This took us to the beginning of 1998 when I got consent from the Argyll and Bute Council and could go ahead with the formal offer to buy the land. If you think Central and local Government beaurocracy is slow you haven't dealt with the Ecclesiastical version! The purchase was not concluded until May 1999!

Then fate took a hand, for once not to my disadvantage, and I got the chance to retire 2 years early. This was too good to miss so I took it and immediately started talking to an architect, John Wilson in Oban. From a sketch design that I gave him he worked up a detailed design which we sent to the council for their approval in November.

Planning consent was easy but the siting and drainage from the septic tank proved to be less so. First of all the building inspector who was over in February saw the site when the whole of Colonsay was running with water and bogs had formed where no bog had any right to be and things did not look good. However a high tech solution was found using a treatment plant rather than a septic tank. So far so good. But then the Clyde River Purification Board got their three pennyworth in and said that we would get no advantage from this plant. So back a few squares. Then a knight in shining armour, in the form of Kevin Byrne, came to the rescue and suggested that the Church would not object if I applied to put the soakaway on the far side of the road on what was also Church land. Problem, we hope, solved.

So now I have a hole in the ground which Nigel has had dug as a start to preparing the site, the foundations are being dug and I have sold my old house and have moved onto the Island to a rented cottage.

So that's where we are now.


Editors note: A. McG. has kindly agreed that updates will be given (hopefully, with each issue of "The Corncrake"); as the project unfolds smoothly and easily, other readers may be inspired to relocate to Colonsay.

### ORAN PHADHRAIG

In an earlier issue, reference was made to Donald Clark, skipper of the "Dunara Castle". The following song was composed by him and exists in his own hand. The original is on official paper of "Glasgow and Highland Royal Mail Steamers - David MacBrayne Ltd" but undated. Many thanks to Alastair Scouller who transcribed the piece and inserted accents etc.

>An cuala sibh fhathast mar a thachair do Ph�dhraig?
>Chaidh e air turus a shealltainn a ch�irdean.
>Dh'fhalbh e a Ghlascho air an Dunara -
>Madainn Di-m�irt a chaidh e air b�rd.
>
>Nuair theann i ri astar, 'sann chaidh e gu h-iosal,
>Botall 'na achlais a fhuair e bho L�osaidh.
>Thuirt e, "S beag agamsa gaoth no droch sh�de

### Website to explore

Website of the week: In the article above, introducing the "Spencer" to our columns, gratitude was expressed to Ann Bonnell of PEI, a Colonsay descendant. Ann has researched Pioneer graveyards and has published the memorials of many departed Colbhasaichs � follow this link to see for yourself: http://www.rootsweb.com/~pictou/lilsands.htm

The link will bring you to Little Sands Cemetery, from which you can find Woods Island and many others. Or try some shipping lists - no doubt there is plenty of information on the "Spencer".

### Readers Write

Correspondence has included an interesting letter from a great-grandson of Duncan McPhee, born in Colonsay 25 July 1843 and himself the son of Angus McPhee (born in Jura 1811) and Jane Buie. The family emigrated c. 1850 and Angus died on the way, being buried on an island in the St.Lawrence river near Quebec City. Duncan was easily traced in the Colonsay records, as were details of his parents' marriage and the "christianing" of his younger brothers, Malcolm and Duncan. Please get in touch if this family is one of "yours". Two very interesting publications were also received this week, for which we are much indebted. Mrs. Paul Fromen sent a copy of "An Account of The Battle of Knocknanuss 1647" by D. O'Donoghue (1993) which contains a wealth of information from the Irish tradition, including valuable genealogical references to Alasdair MacCholla of Colonsay. The other title is "From Island to Island: The Family of Neil Munn and Elizabeth MacLeod" by L. Ann Coles and Linda C. Harding (ISBN 0 9699 9430 3). Running to over 350 pp., this excellent work is carefully researched and referenced. Neil was born in Colonsay 1798 and emigrated c. 1818 (just before the important exodus aboard the "Economy"); he worked as a schoolteacher and will be a useful cue for the publication of a highly-relevant letter from Colonsay in a coming edition of the "Corncrake". Readers are invited to submit suggestions and material for publication. Contact

Corncrake is published to keep all our friends in touch with life on the island. Contributions are invited and welcomed.
Fortnightly editions will carry details of coming events, special offers etc. Please send letters and proposals for specific articles to
the Editor
Brief genealogical and related queries are also welcome from Colbhasachs overseas, as are obituaries and family traditions relating to Colonsay emigrants.
This publication will hopefully develop to reflect the interests of the readership so please feel free to make your contribution. The magazine section needs articles on flora, fauna, geology, fishing, crofting etc.
