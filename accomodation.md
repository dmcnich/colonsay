Colonsay is a wee island in the Hebrides, standing proudly between [Islay][] and [Mull][]. Even though the island only measures ten miles by two (including little [Oransay][] to the south), and even though there are only 135 of us living here, we are a welcoming and lively community. You can come to see us from [Oban][] by [ferry][] most days in the summer, and three days a week [in the winter][]. You can even [fly to Colonsay][] on a Tuesday or Thursday.

We have a list right here of [places to stay][], and rest assured you'll find plenty to do on your trip: we have a [hotel][] with a restaurant and bar, a [shop][] if you stay self-catering, [two][] [cafes][] if that sounds like too much work, and you can visit our [brewery][] and [bookshop][] too. For those of a more sporting bent, [hire a bike][] and race round our eight miles of road. We also have an 18 hole golf course and plenty of fish that need catching; best to enquire at the pub about fees for both.

If you can't decide *when* to come to see us, how about heading over for one of our festivals? There's the [Book Festival][] in April, the [Festival of Spring][] in early May, the [Rugby Festival][] in July, our much-loved folk festival [Cèol Cholasa][] in September, and the [Food and Drink Festival][] in October. Each of them promises a great time, and a focus for your visit. Alternatively, why not come over for a [beekeeping course][]?

Whenever you come, we can promise you one thing: you'll fall in love with the island, and the time between one visit and the next will have you staring longingly at [the views][] you've left behind.
